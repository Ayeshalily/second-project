            <p>Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner. It is centered around a series of action-adventure
                 games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince, set in ancient and medieval Persia.

                The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia (1989) and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame (1993),
                were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D (1999), named for being the first installment to use 3D computer 
                graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC; the Dreamcast version 
                was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise 
                in 2001 and rebooted it with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003). Ubisoft has since developed and published
                four additional entries in the series: Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones
                (2006), Prince of Persia (2008), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010), as well as a number of spin-offs 
                and games for mobile devices.
    
                Outside of the games, the franchise also includes a film adaptation based on The Sands of Time, written in part by
                Mechner, and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010; a graphic novel; and the Lego Prince of Persia toyline. 
                Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed franchise is considered to be the spiritual successor to the series.[1][2][3]</p>

                    The success of the Prince of Persia series resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series 6 world 
                    records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include First Motion-Capture 
                    Animation in a Video Game and Highest Rated Platformer on PS2 and Xbox.</p>
